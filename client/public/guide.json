Matt, our rep, came up with ideas to fit within our budget - and had immense patience with our endless questions. Nick, the captain, asked where we wanted to go (I assumed there was a strict route, nice surprise) and set up Christmas music to play throughout the evening. Rachel, our on board contact, did EVERYTHING, so I was able to enjoy myself instead of working the entire evening. I felt so guilty, I tried to help, but she insisted with such kindness. Corsica, our bartender, was so sweet - and quick! There was never a line for drinks. The boat was decorated beautifully - and somehow they arranged for the rain to stop ;) I'd love to have our party with them every year.",

I could have wandered through it all day. The glass exhibits are so colorful and gorgeous. Pieces are unique and whimsical. I had not read much about it, and was so surprised at how spectacular it was.  The museum has many large indoor  rooms, and the garden is unbelievable. You really have to see it.There is also a Cafe (check out the decor even if you don't eat there.) and a lovely gift shop.  Highly recommended!",

There is also a glass blowing demonstration.  Definitely worth the admission.  There are also street performers right outside and a hot dog stand where you can get authentic Seattle hot dog.  Take some time in the garden and atrium to get shots of the Space Needle and glass art together. On a side note the bathrooms have collections of bottle openers and there is an empty side cafe near the bathrooms with collections of accordions , dolls and other collectibles.  It’s worth a look.",

I arrived around 4:00 pm, which was great as tickets are discounted after 4 pm. The museum took about an hour to go through, and that included a glass blowing show. The glass was beautiful - I never thought you could do what Chihuly did to glass. He created some stunning art with it. The glass blowing show was interesting also. They have a gift shop that sells some of the glass artwork (for a very hefty price, of course).",

You come in, order your food, eat it at one of the few spots that will likely open up because the size of the place forces everyone to stick to their business, eat their food and leave fast so that others can eat theirs. It makes people considerate--what a brilliant use of square footage.\n\nThe counter is lined with small jars of jam and marmalade you can buy, you can watch your food being made, and the back wall is lined with an Alice in Wonderland mural. It. Is. Perfect.\n\nAnd the food: it's all crumpets--savory and sweet, and delicious! I was able to try the 'Vermont' (maple butter, walnuts and creme cheese); the smoked salmon, creme cheese and cucumber; and the ricotta with rasberry preserves. Heaven. I kept saying heaven while eating too.\n\nThey also have a great selection of teas and espresso as well as fresh orange juice. \n\nThis is probably one of favorite food places on the entire continent. I have their store bag (everything of theirs is exponentially cute) framed and up in my room. 💕",

I cannot get enough of this place! Over 6 years, their smoked salmon Crumpet has remained exactly the same. That's bloody amazing! It's literally the best Crumpet shop I've been to either side of the pond. If you're ever in town you absolutely have to visit this place. The staff are always friendly and helpful!",

There's also a great selection of teas and coffees. \n\nThey aren't cheap, but nothing in the market or rest of the downtown area is. The staff are very pleasant and helpful.",

We liked how they identified specific people to follow their story, and the roughly half hour movie is worth watching.  There is even a section of history about the building the museum is in. Parking was right across street, however it is costly like everywhere else in Seattle. Main negative is the huge number of people sleeping on the sidewalks here. I've read about Seattle's homeless problem and is it sure on display in this area, from the tent city in the park nearby to those in sleeping bags all around the parking area.",

But all the more reason to come back and try one of everything!",

I had a limited of time in Seattle and this tour was a great introduction to one of Seattle's most iconic attractions. My expectations were surpassed with the amount of stops and places we visited on the tour. The variety of the food was a great way to experience the diversity of the market. Tastings of authentic northwest clam chowder, gelato, salmon, crumpets, pickle brine, meat and crackers, and fresh fruit were among the foods I thoroughly enjoyed. The serving sizes were more than enough and by the end of the tour I was very full and happy. \n\nOur tour guide Penny was very funny and it was clear she was very passionate about Seattle and the Market. Her exuberant personality made exploring the market an eye opening experience. She also served as a facilitator, so it made getting to know other people on the tour easy and natural. I took home great souvenirs from my time at the Pike Place and even better memories of the people and the food. ",

Has a coffee bar for trying their exclusive drinks, a real bar, and Italian food. The special coffee drinks they have are actually really interesting and unique.

I don't understand why they don't just put in a host stand for the tables/seating so you don't have to prowl around people enjoying their food and beverage like a predator.

Good fermentation, crispy, clean, and healthy tasting. The macaroons were also excellent. Not a fan of their savory breads, cold and out of place. Most bakeries are one dimensional, chemical like, and bland tasting. La Panier is all about sophisticated flavors and quality. The coffee was good and balanced, but took about 15 minutes. Went on a Saturday, so it's understandable. I'll try to make it on a weekday.",

You have the Puget Sound on the west side and the downtown skyline on the east side. And after the Alaskan Way viaduct comes down in a few months the views gonna get a lot better! Anyway, I hope it's everything you wish it to be and have fun!! (:",

Made to order teriyaki menu is excellent, fresh vegetables, quality meat, delicious clean flavor and well prepared, not saucy, perfect amount of spicy kick, one of the best teriyaki in downtown Seattle. Made to order sandwich deli and usual small grocery items and beverages. Old and a bit dingy feeling but courteous service and excellent hot food! Don't judge quality from exterior. Convenient downtown location to hotels, office buildings, library and I-5.",

I had a limited of time in Seattle and this tour was a great introduction to one of Seattle's most iconic attractions. My expectations were surpassed with the amount of stops and places we visited on the tour. The variety of the food was a great way to experience the diversity of the market. Tastings of authentic northwest clam chowder, gelato, salmon, crumpets, pickle brine, meat and crackers, and fresh fruit were among the foods I thoroughly enjoyed. The serving sizes were more than enough and by the end of the tour I was very full and happy. \n\nOur tour guide Penny was very funny and it was clear she was very passionate about Seattle and the Market. Her exuberant personality made exploring the market an eye opening experience. She also served as a facilitator, so it made getting to know other people on the tour easy and natural. I took home great souvenirs from my time at the Pike Place and even better memories of the people and the food. ",

Loading zone below accessed through a tunnel. Parking area is located east in another tunnel. I don't understand the huge glass dome over an avenue. We have strange architecture for sure. Freeway Park is nearby where places to sit are there.",

The tour guide was super engaging and fun, and he touched on everything from indigenous history, to the founding and development of Seattle, to the current culture and scene -- even recommending places for Happy Hour! He was truly a wealth of information. Anything he didn't talk during the main portions of the tour that I was curious about I could pull him aside while walking to the next spot and he was able to fill in the gaps for me every time. Have so much appreciation for this experience.",

We were given a great amount of information about Seattle, which gave us the confidence to explore the city deeper on our own. Jake was engaging and provided us with a great number of recommendations for restaurants, bars, and experiences around Seattle. He emphasized that he was not being paid to provide recommendations and wished to provide us with his honest opinion about Seattle, which was highly appreciated. Overall, I would highly recommend going on a Seattle Free Walking Tour, if you want an immersive, interactive, affordable, and humorous picture of Seattle.",

It was easy to check in, the boarding process was quick, and it seemed like an adventure. The airplanes seem to be well kept also. The only downside (if you are not a fan of flying) is it can get a bit bumpy at times since you're much lower in altitude and in smaller planes. I would definitely do this again.",

Although we have flown with them many times before, it’s just plan fun and worth the price of admission to take off from water, fly at low altitude and land in the middle of the hustle and bustle of Victoria Harbour. As we deplaned we were literally just steps away from our host’s boat. \nOn the return trip our friends had moved and were now moored At Roche  Harbor Resort on San Juan Island, Wa. When it was time to leave we stepped from the boat and walked to the end of the dock. Within a few minutes Kenmore Air landed and taxied into their tie-up area. A few minutes later we’re accelerating across the water of the Harbor as we takeoff en route to Lake Union; next door to downtown Seattle. When we land a shuttle is waiting to whisk us away to Sea-Tac Airport for our flight home to California. An incredible trip where Kenmore made the travel so convenient and uncomplicated! They are wonderful to work with. You might consider a romantic 2 night getaway surprise for your honey. It’s easy as pie! Trust me, you will be rewarded!",

Prior to our visit to Seattle, my husband did research on restaurants and the Market Grill was listed. We went there this past Sunday and we were not disappointed. It’s a small stand in the bustling Pike Place market but don’t let the small size fool you. The staff was nice and super friendly and the food was exceptional. My husband ordered the salmon platter and I got the Icelandic cod sandwich. The fish was so fresh and perfectly seasoned. My husband also sampled the clam chowder which he said was truly delicious. I wish we had gotten the name of the guy that took our order. He was super friendly and welcomed us as if we were personal guests at his home. The chef, Jason, was also friendly and did a superb job preparing our meal. Seating is somewhat of an issue (limited number of barstools) but the turnover rate was pretty quick. I would highly recommend this restaurant.",

I particularly enjoyed the exhibit on horror, as it's a genre that has contributed greatly to our culture but is often viewed as less worthy of study than other media genres. The special exhibit on Marvel was really cool too! It was interesting to see how the stories have been translated/changed for different media formats as well as over time.",

The architecture is beautiful, even if a bit easy to get lost in (but your in Seattle anyways...), and a great use of copper as a main color. If your in Seattle and need absorb yourself in the history of all things popular, come here.",

If you do it right, you can pass by the gum wall, get coffee and go up the stairs to the public market and see people throwing fish. \n\nBest coffee ever. I got the Salted Nut Latte and it was thus far, my best coffee experience. Not too acidic. Perfect roast level. Not too salted. All my friends enjoyed their drinks. It's a tight squeeze but that's the vibe and I love it. They don't have a bakery in case you are hungry for a snack but I want this place back home! 10/10.",

Kim was our tour guide, and she was awesome. We really appreciated that she's a real paranormal investigator...she was very knowledgeable and relatable and answered many of the guests' questions with ease. The only slight disappointment was the length of time in the Underground. This is not the tour for you if you want to see a large portion of Seattle's underground. It really is the stories that make the tour. We would definitely recommend for anyone who likes ghost stories and wants a little excitement and terror in their evening.",

You get to walk through the building and they have it setup to tell the story of the 1920s with people who actually worked in Smith Tower. It was so fun! You get to interact with the displays (for example, a switchboard). The service was amazing! View is amazing! Chocolate truffle dessert brought tears to my eyes 😍🤤",

The server was very helpful and the food delicious . Their chicken wings were a super hit at the table .we ordered  chicken fried rice with sea weed , some dish which has garden vegetables ( it's a cold dish with quinoa for the weight watchers) , pork was ordered and devoured by friends . Finally one of my Friend who is a vegetarian ordered for the glass noodles without the meat and told the server that he would like it spicy and they made it super spicy ( no complaints ) and the dish was delicious . I had tears in my eyes and my friend was sweating it out but all of us left with a smile. The Korean beer was very nice says my boy friend . Oh! They don't take reservations , so you have to walk in and wait for the table to be allocated . Warm people so you wouldn't have a problem hanging around . Sorry didn't click any pics as lighting was low and we were all starving after a hike . ",

Caitlin did a phenomenal job leading us up and down Pike Place Market with tons of great Seattle and food tips/history along the way. We got to skip the very long lines at some of Pike Place's most popular attractions to get delicious food including Russian pastries and clam chowder (with equally-delicious vegetarian options for my wife). At the end, we even got a VIP pass with coupons to several additional Pike Place vendors. Definitely worth doing while you're in Seattle, and in our case we'll likely do it again next time we're in town!",

It was a well thought out and tasty tour, but finding good food in the Pike Place Market is like shooting fish in a barrel.  The tour provides a good overview of the highlights of the market and includes a lot of stops at several great places. Mark a Seattle native was an incredible tour guide and really loves his job, food, and Seattle.  He was a real treat and you should ask for him on your tour.  He was very attentive and was eager for questions and to provide excellent suggestions for anything specific we were looking to find.  We have been on food tours all around the world and this one was one of the best we have done.",

She remembered every single person's name with ease and made sure each person felt included and important. I was visiting for business and attended the tour by myself, and yet she made me feel like part of the group.  This entire program was very well-run and organized. I would recommend it to anyone visiting Seattle. It was clear the company has been around long enough to anticipate what could go wrong and be proactive to ensure full satisfaction. I'm also impressed  that the company takes the time to respond to everyone's reviews. It was easily a five-star experience and the highlight of my trip.",

Justin’s explanation of the market’s history and stories made all the difference.  The food samples were amazing and filling, and it was so nice that we didn’t have to wait in any lines, the tour had all the stops set up in advance. I highly recommend this tour-worth every penny!",

I think that's brilliant and offers a great service to those who can't afford to pay $30 to go through an educational museum. Beautiful artwork and wonderful staff.

Lots of pieces from local Native American artists and Canadian First Nations art.  Also some older art pieces from Mexico, interspersed with modern art pieces. One of my favourite pieces was a psychedelic video installation. There was also a temporary exhibition about Jodhpur in India, but I don't find that particularly interesting. All in all it is worth a visit.",

We got the tater tots w/fried egg \u0026 gravy which is a great appetizer and the $8 debris sandwich (pork, smoked cheddar, fried egg, fritos). \n\nThey have a selection of whiskey that they age in their own barrels from some of the top distilleries around the country like Eagle Rare \u0026 Maker's Mark. If you're looking for some good whiskey downtown, but sure to stop by for this really popular happy hour spot.",

Cool funky decor and some good music set the stage for  a good time the drinks kick like some pioneer 12s, but are very well crafted.

We thought the whiskey/bourbon selection was okay (we're not far from Bourbon Country, so we're used to seeing quite a bit more) and the bartenders were friendly.  Prices were a little high for the drinks and given how small the place was, it did feel a bit cramped as more people came in for happy hour.  Didn't get a chance to try anything on the food menu unfortunately, but it looked good.\n\nPoint of note: This place is a little tucked out of the way and can be a little difficult to find at first if you're not paying attention.  Facing the main entrance to the Pike Market, go to the building on the right - there will be stairs going up to the second level and that's where you'll find Radiator.",

Nothing is obstructed since it is located in the tallest building in downtown, Seattle. We have been here several times and everyone we've spoken to is very friendly and knowledgeable. And if they aren't, they find the right people who can help you. They throw some really great events that I would highly recommend checking out such as Pride events, 4th of July, yoga, Sunset experiences, etc. The events get pretty busy and packed but if you go on any regular day, the views are breathtaking and it's rather tranquil. They also have fun games like Connect Four if you just want to sit and take in the views. Regardless, definitely a place to check out with the whole family or a perfect place for date night!",

Plus: a 360-view of the city and bay from the center of the action; great food at \"down to earth\" prices; view-rooms to hang out and play supplied games for as long as you want; explanations of the landmarks you're looking at painted on the interior walls; optional photos of your group with Bigfoot; and a fast, dedicated large bank of elevators that eliminates lines. Also, the Needle is nicer to look at than sit atop. \n\nOne caveat: parking. As with most of the rest of downtown Seattle, a visitor can spend hours looking for street parking, park blocks away for an exorbitant price, or try to park in the heart of the action for an insanely expensive price and probably be turned down because the lot is full. Cities like this have merely to look to Provo, Utah to see how plentiful free parking turns a dying city center into a vibrant communal destination.",

The views are amazing, the staff are really nice, the drinks were $10 each.  It was a really great experience, much better than the crowded space needle.

You can purchase tickets online or on-the-spot. The experience starts in the elevator and once you reach the Observatory, the scenic view hits you. We saw ferries transporting cars, the highway traffic, the Space Needle and the Stadiums, the harbor and many more. It is very educational for the kids too. Food and beverage can be purchased while you enjoy the view. Parking is available on the street. A must-see place in Seattle in my humble opinion!",

Then, you are transported in a place where you do a select amount of things but you master them to perfection. \nTheir salami show decades of experience on how to measure the right ingredients for a perfect experience for the senses. \nThe mole salami is non traditional but a must try associating the sweetness of mole with the spices of the salami. \nThe sandwiches are also fabulous. Over the years, my favorite is the porchetta but their meatball sandwich is also a wonder of flavors. \nNot to be left behind, the cold cut sandwich - especially with fresh mozzarella - are also great. \nThe lines may be long and your chances of searing at one of the very few tables small but it is all worth it. \nDon’t miss this opportunity for a one of a kind gastronomic experience.",

Food is also rather overpriced. I paid in excess of $30 USD excluding a tip for a simple dinner for one with no alcoholic beverage. Be aware that the ride share pick up area is not very easy to find. You have to go to the parking garage then go one floor down to level 3. It took a while for my ride to get there because of traffic congestion. Also, when you get off the plane, you have to take a bus to the actual airport. There is no tunnel or bridge. The bus took a long time and smelled terrible.",

We don't usually eat anything so fancy and our waiter made us feel very comfortable and thoroughly explained the different cuts of beef and provided us  recommendations on dishes. Every part of the meal as quite excellent as well. The bread was warm and delicious. We had the calamari as an appetizer and every piece was tender and none over chewy. Of course what this places comes down to is the quality of the steak. My family sampled the rib eye, sirloin, prime rib, and cap top. Each piece was cooked just right and had excellent flavor. Dessert was bananas foster and it was great as well. It was overall a lot of food and the staff very kindly packed up our leftovers. Overall, an excellent experience and would recommend for your choice of steakhouse in Seattle.",

We went out on a pretty cold, misty April night and it was amazing to be sitting in the hot tub in what would not typically be considered boat weather. We jumped in the lake a few times and the hot/cold felt really good. The city was beautiful at night with the mist and lights. It was also really nice to know that they change the water after each customer. I can't wait to go again!",

Enjoy soaking in the 100deg clean water (renewed after each excursion) or sit up on the flush decks as you pilot around Lake Union in Seattle’s heart. \n\nSilent electric drive is easy for novice boaters to use, and most of all this is FUN. This can even be a thing during Seattle’s cool wet winters. Just need a bathing suit and a rain hat!\n\nAn experience you won’t forget. Treat yourself and a few friends. Do it! I did!",

The staff were also very considerate towards making the clients feel comfortable while in line. They were polite and very helpful at times. It is an experience I would definitely take my family to again. The experience is very expensive, I honestly thought for what you pay that there would have been more to offer the paying customer but overall it was a great experience for adults and children.

She was very knew a ton of history of Seattle and was quick to answer any questions. \nTip: bring a few bucks to tip these guys. They try hard for laughs and to keep it light. They are hustling just as hard as waiters and bartenders!",

For the $20 (student rate) each you get a great 60-75 minute tour of 3 segments of the underground part of Seattle. The real reason to come is the humor of the guides, and a good understanding of English will significantly help enjoyment. The humor is PG-13, but for adults there is definitely a second layer to grasp and laugh at.\n\nOne slight negative - overly pushy of merchandise/photo's at the end and tips are actively sollicited. Well deserved, everyone tips, but they should not have to ask!",

With stunning views of Seattle, and interesting history, and great dining the Space Needle is one of my favorite visits ever. The tickets are slightly pricey, but it is definitely worth the experience. The elevator is very fun to go up and the place is well maintained. You also may meet awesome people up there to. People taking photos and some just observing the magnificence of Seattle! This is an awesome visit and I’m very happy that I went!",

The wait time was about an hour and it was cold! The only place to wait is inside the gift shop a and there is no seating in or around the gift shop.\n\nThe gift shop wasn’t too badly priced.

I particularly enjoyed the exhibit on horror, as it's a genre that has contributed greatly to our culture but is often viewed as less worthy of study than other media genres. The special exhibit on Marvel was really cool too! It was interesting to see how the stories have been translated/changed for different media formats as well as over time.",

The architecture is beautiful, even if a bit easy to get lost in (but your in Seattle anyways...), and a great use of copper as a main color. If your in Seattle and need absorb yourself in the history of all things popular, come here.",

Granted I do judge Mac and cheese harshly, and it wasn't bad Mac and cheese but something about it was off. It took a few bites for it to get good. When it does though the flavors come out but I feel there is something just a little off about it. But definitely not bad. The grilled cheese was decent but I really wish they'd use another bread other Than Sour dough, and like the Mac and cheese it took a few bites for it to get good. Cheese curdled Were pretty good though. I'd say people can come judge for themselves what the hype is about but if there's a huge line....... It's OK to skip it.",

It's also really pricey, but I don't care, I took home a really yummy wheel of brie and some cheese curds; they have samples; and finally I ate a really good grilled cheese sandwich and took a bite of amazing mac n cheese.  However, there's barely any seating, but what are you gonna do about that?  It's a small place in a busy area, you can't expect a lot of open seats.",

My husband and I had an amazing time learning about the history of Seattle and Jim narrates it beautifully!  He made learning history so much fun and left us wanting to learn more about \"Underground Seattle\"  Can't wait to go back and learn more.  I highly recommend this tour for anyone traveling to that gorgeous city!!",

The tour was led by Jim Gall, a charismatic, knowledgeable guide who made the history of Seattle come to life, was very entertaining, and made a point of learning everyone's names and where we were all from which gave the tour a more personal feel which was really nice. In short, beneath the streets is a very enjoyable and informative tour and I would highly recommend it. Just one note - be sure to keep in mind that very little of the city's underground has been preserved so don't expect a labyrinth or you may be disappointed! :)",

The tour is more intimate (groups will max out at half the size) and factual, and our guide Jim gave us some fantastic recommendations for what to do afterwards, giving us an excuse to visit Smith Tower!\n\nI won't spoil the sights you'll see, but your guide will give you a glimpse at early Seattle and the modern establishments that still connect to it! Absolutely worth the cost of admission, and if you are early, there's a spooky museum connected to the business that you can check out for free.",

The tall glass windows were beautiful and added a little something extra to the ambience of the place. Beautiful, peaceful everything a library should be.",

This stunning display of architecture is a beautiful centerpiece of the otherwise skyscraping business district.\n\nThere are many grand, expansive reading rooms, as well as a great number of cozy nooks throughout the building. The library is kept as a very nice, quiet environment for reading and studying. There is a no cell phone rule, that I believe is observed by most everyone.\n\nI really enjoyed checking out the map room in one of the top floors. If you go in the evening, you'll have many rooms and aisles to yourself. And many of the reading nooks are quite private, while providing a nice view of the surrounding architecture.\n\nThis is a great stop if you're touring around downtown on foot. I was here in February, and it was a lovely place to warm up and read a little. A lot of people seem to avoid the library because of the homeless folks who frequent it, but they're the public too, and I had no negative interactions with anyone. It was a clean, quiet and comfortable environment.",

Nice folks really.  Don't be afraid to engage and make their day awesome as much as they do for us.\n\nThe general line up you can always expect is maple, bacon maple, sugar \u0026 cinnamon, plain and powdered sugar.  There is usually a special as well.",

These little dudes descend from the pearly gates right down to your mouth in multiples of 6 and are, simply put, the best donuts we've ever had! Each one was a yummy hug of love!\n\nYou watch the donuts go from dough to golden goodness right before your eyes as they go from the pan into the fryer and then, via conveyor belt, into the bowl where they wait for you to take one plus five of his friends home! \n\nFlavors of plain, cinnamon and sugar, powdered and chocolate w/ sprinkles are your everyday donuts de jour and are amazing. The PLAIN AND CINNAMON SUGAR COME OUT HOT - the way a true donut should. Outsides were crispy and golden brown with a fluffy inside. These dudes and dudettes are mini donuts and thus it's pretty easy for two people to house a dozen. For 6 assorted, we paid less than 3 bucks! \n\nThe peeps manning the station were definitely Seattle fare and very nice. The coffee was solid - I had a shot in the dark (espresso in coffee) and it was better than I've had most places. They counter is adorned by many an action figure including the teenage mutant ninja turtle Raphael - The one who was rough around the edges, but with a heart of gold - just like this place!\n\nYou need to try this place - it's straight up amazing! These donuts are inexpensive, but far and away better than anything we've had. A couple steps up from crispy cream and just plain fun. Try this place and you won't be disappointed!",

We arrived a bit ahead of our reservation time but we were seated promptly. Servers were informative and helpful and friendly. Plan to make an evening out of dining as there were long breaks between bread, cocktails and main course. Not inattentive but just slower than I expect or enjoy. We split a salad and main course as we had snacked earlier and were not super hungry. Items were brought to the table split which was great! Steak was ordered medium and it came to the table with very little pink. Overall, good meal with great atmosphere and good service.",
