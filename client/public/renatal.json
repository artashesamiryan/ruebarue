In the beach alleys, recycling bins attract scavengers who rummage through the bins late at night to illegally collect recyclables, leaving strewn trash behind. In such high-density communities, sometimes there isn’t enough room for trash and recycle bins, so others will place refuse in the recycle bins and the city will not empty those containers, leading to unsanitary conditions. We have tried locking the bins, but if guests do not unlock in time for collection, the bins will stay full and there is not enough room for overflow. We are petitioning the city for other solutions and apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you. If you have any concerns or suggestions, we welcome your call.",

It was much better than I ever expected. Highly recommended. Do it!",

She made the experience that much more memorable. We saw a nursery pod of bottle nose dolphins with a few baby dolphins that looked like they were just born. They were the cutest little things. We also saw a MEGA pod of dolphins, seemed like we saw over 1000 dolphins! Absolutely incredible. The dolphins get right up to the side of the boat, like two feet from your face! Jumping in the air right next to you. You need to go see this!",

This helps because you can get to locations where a whale is spotted by the many people sharing information over the radio.\n\nOur captain Christine was very friendly and made us feel secure. She knew the waters really well and had a lot of information to share on the whales, dolphins and sea lions that she has seen so far. Since there were only 6 people onboard it gave a feeling of a more private tour than the larger boats.\n\nWe were able to spot a grey whale and a lot of dolphins. We also saw a few sea lions playing about in the water which was really cute as well.",

Food was only okay, but took forever to get.  \n\nAlso, it is very top-heavy in employees, yet little attention to folks whom walk in while the handful of waitstaff caters to anyone else besides us.  We simply walked in and sat down, were asked by a waiter what to drink, he fixed us up with the requested water, coffee and tea, and that was it for service for a very long wait.",

I highly recommend you come to this bar for football games. The atmosphere is so fun. It feels like you are at the Stadium in Minnesota cheering on your home team. They have a good alcohol selection, good food, and great service. I recommend getting there early so you can have a seat to sit in. I also recommend getting their breakfast shot. Jameson, bacon, and OJ. Everything you could want on a Sunday Morning. SKOL VIKINGS!!!!",

The flowers at the stands were gorgeous, I wish I could have bought them all!",

Weather was great and we were able to see 3-4 gray whales, plus some California Sea Lions, and a variety of birds. \n\nReservations were easy to make and I’d strongly recommend doing so. We found plenty of parking on the street and a short walk to check in. General boarding lined up along the fence and it actually got a little warm in the sun. A small awning for shade would have been nice, but it reminded us we should have brought sunscreen and the nearby Marina store was open and reasonable. \n\nOur Boat (Privateer) was roomy, clean, and had plenty of outside seating. Captain did his best to make sure everyone on both sides had opportunities to see the whales. Guests were free to move about. Crew was very good and helpful when one of my kids started feeling ill providing remedies and checking in on us. Snack bar has a variety of refreshments and even binoculars available for rent. The biologist provided just the right amount of information about the area and whale behavior with out overwhelming us with details. \n\nOverall a great day.",

While out we saw a grey whale calf with its mother, a couple other grey whales, a pod of a couple hundred dolphins, and some other marine animals such as sea lions , and pelicans. I would highly recommend! The crew was friendly and very knowledgeable! We used a Groupon and got a great deal. We went when there weren’t maybe people in February and we got to move all around the boat whenever we wanted. Also had snacks and drinks on board. We bought binoculars for $5 as well and my husband really liked using those. Lots of fun!",

Our captain, Jon, and his deckhand, Trevor, were personable and great to spend 5.5 hours with! We ended up catching over 35 Rock Fish, which Trevor did a great job having them ready for us to take home by the time we got back.  These two know their stuff and especially know where the fish are swimming! Next time I go deep sea fishing in San Diego, I absolutely will go through Coletta Sportfishing again! Best in San Diego!",

Ended our half day trip with 23 yellowtail and a few sand bass. All were caught casting on lures and no bait! True definition of sport fishing! I have an outfitting business of my own on the fresh water and Was extremely impressed with Coletta! Excellent service and catching one after another for the entire trip! Thanks guys!",

Chris Coletta called me shortly after booking to let me know that the tuna bite could be great or it could be nonexistent by that time.  He informed me that we would play it by ear.  If the offshore bite was good, we would go offshore.  If the bite was inconsistent, then it would be best to change our trip to a 3/4 day inshore trip.  When time came for our trip, the tuna had moved on.  Chris called me to let me know and promptly refunded me the price difference.  We met our captain, John, and first mate, Matt at the dock at 6:30.  They were prompt, professional, and easy to fish with. And these guys really know how to put their clients on fish. Overall we caught 7 different species and left with a great bounty of meat for the freezer.  I am supremely grateful that Chris and his crew suggested the trip change.  It was an awesome experience.   recommend Coletta Sportsfishing to anyone, (novice or experienced) for their supreme courtesy and professionalism.",

I tried both. I take simple capsule probiotics daily, so I noticed no digestive difference but I'd definitely opt for Bio-K+ next time I take flora-destroying antibiotics. Stryve offers smoked and original flavors of air-dried beef snacks. Both flavors are very good. I bought the original flavor pack at $4 introductory price. I probably won't buy often at $7 regular price. But I had a hard time stopping from eating this high protein quality beef snacking pack. Addictive!Original flavor is seasoned with vinegar and raisin juice plus spices, and once you start snacking you can save those flavors enhancing the beef. Delicious!",

Never been on a kayak and I'm not especially athletic, so I was a little nervous about feeling clumsy or behind, but I didn't need to be.  LJK's staff was amazing, and our guides, Eric and Jack, were especially friendly, helpful, and knowledgeable.  Their stories and local information really enhanced the experience and gave us good opportunities to catch our breath.  Being on the ocean was exhilarating.  The wave swells were too wild to go in the caves, but that made it fun in a very different way.  \n\nThis was just a ton of fun and a new thing that I will put on my list to do with out of town visitors!",

First it was fabulous getting out and doing something I have never done before. Our guide made sure I knew what I was doing and how to be safe the entire time. Kayaking on the ocean gave me a whole new perspective on La Jolla. Throw in the seals that are swimming around, you end up with a great day.",

Do yourselves a favour and just rent some kayaks and do the area on your own time. Theres not much to this area and I wouldn’t be intimidated without a guide. Overall this company is good and I can’t say I didn’t have fun but the guides took themselves far to seriously which kind of retracts from the overall experience. If your like me and just want to take your time and really soak it up take a firm pass on a guided tour and do it yourself. If your a little intimidated by the water these guys will keep you safe safe safe!",

Highly recommend this company. \n\nYou order everything online and we picked up the pack \u0026 play and booster chair for my visiting granddaughter. You just need an access code to enter and retrieve the items then you will also return to the same location. We wrote our name on the clipboard both times. \n\nI even added a second item (the booster chair) the day before and they texted me right away if the item will be available. This was also during a holiday so I appreciate the prompt response time.\n\nWhole process was easy and the products were clean!!! I would definitely do it again....oh and don’t forget to put in the note when you order online to apply a military discount if you have an ID.",

We rented a mini crib, Pack N' Play, the waffle toys, bouncer, and high chair. We loved the October special of renting one premium item to get another item free. They handled drop off and pickup for us at our rental house we had for the week. \n\nI really cannot say enough good things about how seamless they made traveling with so many little ones. The quality, convenience, and great communication were spot on. Thanks, Toddler's Travels!",

They were so quick to respond and answer any questions we had and made modifications leading up to our arrival date without any issues. I appreciate that they are flexible with their communication style. Texting works great for me and they were able to text me quick updates and quotes. We ended up renting a pack and play,  high chair, diaper pail, and changing table. Everything was super clean and in great shape and delivered right to our rental house before we even arrived. They worked with the rental management company to coordinate the delivery and pick-up which took one less thing off my plate. I will be for sure using them again and recommending them to all of my friends traveling with kiddos to San Diego. Thanks!",

We came away with more confidence in how to adapt our camera to the scene, learned a lot about the history of San Diego, and had a fabulous time touring a couple of historic parts of San Diego.  As very amateur photographers we had practice with composition, working in manual mode (compared to auto mode to see the difference), and sunset photography.  We found the history of Old Town and Balboa to be fascinating.  Julie was the perfect combination on instructor and guide.  Julie built the  private tour around our specific photography needs and our physical requirements.  If you like to take pictures while travelling but feel your pictures could be better then this tour is for you!",

And an all-around fun experience!\n\nI originally came here to film a commercial for the company, but was treated to a lovely tour of the whole neighborhood and got to see some areas that I’ve never seen before being a native of San Diego.\n\nOur tour guide always said everything with a smile and a very hysterical personality. Made us feel valued as people and ensure that we were having a great time.\n\nThough it was a work trip, it’s a great place to go for a fun trip. \n\nThank you SD fly rides for the outing.",

I only had a glass or two of wine the entire time but the restaurants and dining in wine country down there are top notch 5star farm to table type spots with some of the best food I've had this year. We took a small detour at my request to a special museum showing the history of wine making globally and in Guadalupe Valley. It was a little bit of a drag waiting 15min to cross the border but he said it would have been a lot longer if we did not have the special express pass. Plan to head back down with some friends and will without a doubt be going with Baja Vino.\n\nI speak no Spanish and it was not a problem at all.",

I was stuck in San Diego with my mother after watching my second child graduate from Boot Camp at the Marine Corps Recruit Depot.\n\nWe had several hours to kill, just waiting for planes. I saw the sign underneath a rather impressive collection of architecture and history expertly arranged an built into the hills of San Diego.\n\nI knew that the tour was going to be a combination of history and religious evangelism.  These wonderfully nice people still surprised me.\n\nWe arrived halfway through the Spanish tour whereupon a blue eyed latter-day Saints sister recited, by script, in perfect Spanish, a preview of the tour we were about to undertake.\n\nIt’s not really a tour.\nIt is an interactive, three part,(audience, sister tour guides, and interactive historical characters in wall paintings straight out of Harry Potter) historical/spiritual message.\n\nThe set dressings are surprisingly realistic given the setting. We know that these are props however, the props are REALLY good!\nLike “actual kit or better” good.\n( I’m a little bit of a history buff and I have some long years in set design)\nThe explanations and actual physical props from the US military in that time are spot on accurate from an equipment point of view.\nThe history side is better than expected. However, this is still a mission. So expect a spiritual side.\n\nAt this point I have to tell you, it’s actually an astoundingly positive thing. I wasn’t expecting that.\nAt the beginning of this they bring up a focusing (at least for me)theme\n\nThroughout tribulation, “We chose to be happy” outlined the Latter Day Saints contributions to both California and to the United States of America.\n\nIt was nice to see people who were proud of their faith outlining exactly how that same faith helped frame the west.\n\nThank you for an entertaining and informational afternoon.\n\nPS: There are many who look at this place as a straight on religious conversion center.  You might be right.\n\nBut, at least these people speak from the heart as to what they believe",

The second day I went out with Capt. Lou.  I appreciated Lou's honesty about a hard day of fishing where a shot at a shark meant a good day.  Three hours of staring at a chum line and we had a Blue Shark on the line.  Prior to seeing the fish Lou kept me entertained and laughing.  Lou's passion for the fishery is obvious and his attitude towards life is contagious.  I would recommend a charter with On The Fly Fishing Charters to anyone.",

After talking with Dave on the phone I realized he was an up front and honest guy.  We booked our full day shark trip for later that year.  We fished with Captain Lou and had an amazing time.  Lou was absolutely incredible!  He was so laid back and easy going that it felt like we were fishing with an old friend.  My wife has not fished as much as I have and Lou walked her through exactly what to expect and how to react to the shark.  He was incredibly knowledgeable and patient with the both of us and calmly walked us through each encounter with these amazing fish.  My wife landed the first fish of over 150 lbs and we boated many more!! Needless to say, we were HOOKED!  Since that initial trip we have fished multiple times each year with both Lou and Dave and have recommended On The Fly Fishing Charters to many friends and family who all have had amazing trips!  Here in Utah, I am a part time hunting and fishing guide myself and full time salesman. I have a good idea of what it takes as a guide to do everything possible to have a successful trip and these guys consistently exceed my every expectation. My only caution is be forewarned, you won't fish with these guys just once...!!",

I was with undecicive people \u0026 hungry \u0026 also had to pee so I headed to this grocery store where I passed this beautiful, amazing, fresh salad bar.\nI did my business \u0026 then headed out to make myself a salad (yes I washed my hands) \u0026 they had pretty much everything I would put on my salad so I got no complaints. \nThey are obviously environmentally friendly with their cardboard to go packaging, which a company should be, so close to the ocean. Thank you for that, Gelson's!\nIf just for the salad bar, I highly recommend!!! \nIf you enjoyed this review or found it helpful PLEASE give it a LIKE!",

That’s your first mistake!”\nIt’s the same staff as when this was a Haggen before, and an Albertsons before that, so I’m really not buying the “cost of labor” canned response.\n\nI’m glad the store exists for the convenience, but they sure do gouge you for it, so shop here sparingly. Getting someone to ring you up can also be a challenge which is surprising given how many people seem to be on shift at any given time.",

We could've stuck around longer in each area though. We'd drop lines and then a couple minutes later the captain would tell us to reel in. At least my father-in-law caught one!\n\nThe food was AMAZING. One of the best burgers I've ever had. The breakfast sandwich was delicious too.\n\nThe deckhand was great. Extremely helpful. Double-checked and fixed any tackles that were tied wrong. Gave a demonstration on the best knot he uses. Great demonstration on the fishing itself as well. Always kept plenty of bait in the bins for us.\n\nOnly real issues I have were:\n- we set out a bit later than we were supposed to\n- 2 boat changes the day before and morning of\n- boat was a little crowded at 18 guys going out to fish, would've preferred capping it at maybe 10. obvious they just wanted to make some more cash buy cramming a bit more heads onto the boat\n- didn't stick around long enough at each spot",

Yes, parking sucks and I don't know about the other boats but here is my review of the New Lo An from July 21st, 2017.\n\nDecided to go on the New Lo An since the boat came highly recommended by a friend.  I had never been on the New Lo An before.  The boat has a nice platform for fishing, roomy and double stack rod holders. The galley is smaller than some but comfortable with a nice breeze.  The food was excellent!  Homemade burgers and potato salad. Not like your mom used to make, even better!  Steve is an excellent Chef/Cook. The deckhands were helpful and on point with helping with tangles and tagging fish.  No attitudes or poor service and the fish cleaning was done proficiently and without wast.  Adam was captain on this overnighter and did beyond an excellent job.  We beat the fleet that trip and Adam was definitely the key to that!\n\nThe bunk room was a little hot but they are fairly spacious. Be aware that if you get the top bunks in the center of the bunk room they do not have walls separating your neighbor next door but could be nice if you were bringing along the wife.  Mitch's seafood is located on the dock so you can grab some dinner before you head out but set aside some time because they are busy.\n\nAll in all I can see why this boat has 5 stars even if Point Loma doesn't.  Nothing bad to say at all.  Thanks for a great trip guys...",

We were coming in from out of state and were told we didn't need to bring anything they would provide everything.  Ourselves and several others were given the wrong tackle from the shop  and couldnt even fish and when it was brought up there was zero concern from anyone on the boat. We were treated more like a nuisance than  a paying customer. When we came in the guys that gave us the wrong rig chuckled and said\"yeah man that's like a knife in a gun fight\" really? No attempt to make things right. The right hand doesn't know what the left ones doing and once they have your money they couldn't care anyway. Don't waste your time with this outfit I heard H  and M were decent and will try them next time!",

There are some functioning open shops where they sell items that are handcrafted and of course the kitschy items everyone wants like masks and brightly painted skulls. \n\nThe staff who work here are very friendly and engaging and will literally pull you in off the street to give demonstrations and teach you about the historic significance of the buildings and location. \n\nGreat food here and some shopping as well.",

When I got there Kelly was checking us in and was rude when I realized that I have the rental not the tour. She brought the manager, Kira, don't know why cause she was more negative then her. I guess to have another person telling me I made a mistake. The manager was exactly what you're not supposed to have... negative, raising her voice, not a problem solver. You can see through her face that she enjoyed the power she has to say \"no\". The tour itself was ok. Jacob and Emily were good. They seem knowledgeable and friendly, however, after a bad experience at the check in it's hard to have a pleasant experience. It's not what you say but HOW you say it!

Then, I was in recently at the front counter and over heard the checker say that the pharmacy never picks up the phone. Amazing, especially when we’re talking about people health and medication.\n\nSo to follow up after my original review, I finally got someone to pick up the phone after a half hour wait. When she picked up and I explain to her that I needed to give her the correct fax number for my doctor so she could get a prior authorization on a prescription they were having trouble with. She looked up all my information and asked me to get on hold again, after waiting for another 10 minutes I was put through to a fax machine.\n\nThese people are completely incompetent and should not be handling medications.",

The cashier had no idea what she was doing and referred me to the wrong end of the store for a common item she should know of (OTC hydrocortisone cream) and the manager was unknowledgable regarding current store promotions and deals. Due to her lack of awareness, I had to purchase an item to even see if the deal applied (which she assured me should work just fine...it didn't) and then had to hold up the line to return the item immediately after the discount did not work. Ridiculous...plus there is also a noticeable amount of litter and homeless population surrounding the store. It felt very run down for such a nice and wealthy tourist area (Pacific Beach). Would not recommend to anyone. I would honestly rather drive all the way up to La Jolla or even as far to Clairemont area to visit a different CVS...the experience at this location was that unsatisfactory.",

Our group had a blast together, laughs throughout the entire day!  I would most definitely recommend this tour for anyone!",

You do take a train that allows you to see about 30 seconds of the coast. I am convinced taking this public train is only so they can advertise as a “wine train” \n\nMy friends and I are local to San Diego and wanted to try something different. Everything on this tour can be done without a tour guide without spending extra money to take a train.\n\nIf anyone is really interested in what a wine train is suppose to be look up Napa Valley wine train.",

Our tour only involved two groups which made it feel very private. We went to three vineyards and tried 20 wines throughout the day. The first vineyard was called Domain Artifact and was probably where our favourite wines were at. There was a charcuterie platter that had some excellent snacks to pair with the wine. Since our group was small we were able to tour the vineyard and even try a few late grapes off the vine. The second vineyard was called Orfila which was much more lively and had a bit of a wait for wine at the pour area. We were able to go to the back with the casks and see where the grapes were fermenting. The final stop was Bernardo where we were served some delicious salads and pizza. We were able to pair our wines the chocolate and wind down the night in a nice atmosphere. I would 100% recommend this tour to anyone coming to San Diego.",

The whole process of renting a sailboat and the hand off between employees was incredible. Each person seemed to know we were coming even though it wasn't scheduled ahead of time. They all smiled, were very cordial, and treated us like they were genuinely invested in our experience. The boat itself was good, clean, and maintained well. Like most of their sailboats, they were already rigged up when we walked down to the dock. Couldn't be happier with our experience.",

Everyone was friendly and I highly recommend!!",

Very easily tipped. \n\nOh and if you tip it they charge you a tow fee for $85 then possibly a flood fee for $50 or something. If you suck up seaweed they expect you to go underneath and pull it out or they will charge you a tow fee. They charge in 15 min prorated incriminates when your late.

Not a big deal if you're flexible. I didn't check any luggage but it was easy to find baggage claim.  We did get a rental so had to take the shuttle.   There is a queue to the rental center which is about 7 minutes away.  I want to shout out to Linda.  She made our quick trip go faster.  She led us in some sing a longs and tongue twisters. One passenger teased her with \"Irish wrist watch\".  That one is hard!  It was a good end to our trip.",

They usually deliver to me within an hour or less which isn’t bad considering they have to wait for the food to cook too. Only con I would say is the amount of restaurants I can choose from, I’d say it has a decent amount but could definitely use more. Will be using again",

It's a rather small place and not worth the gate admission price, which I wouldn't have wanted to pay. So I'm really glad that we were able to purchase admission tickets through Costco.",

I lost my daddy 10 yrs ago and we used to go on the tour every summer. Ghosts or no ghosts, thank you for the memories. Anyone who has a chance to go on this beautiful piece of history, definitely needs to. It's  the best! We always took the harbour tour. Loved every minute of it. I hope some day to bring my 2 sons to share in the memories.",

A big shout out to the gentleman working the ticket booth, he was super friendly and ensured we had a great time, I didn’t get his name but he definitely deserves to be noticed.  We will definitely be back!  I highly recommend coming over and taking the tour.  Thanks for the great memories.",

You get to be on a few different types of vessels and a movie famous one, learn to tie knots, see real canons, and see what it took to load these vessels up. You can also add a boat tour of the bay at a very reasonable price for all that you get to see. I would highly recommend this place.",

But they signed off on our ticket so we may come back. So that's cool. We took the boat tour (not the fast one) and it was nice. In fact that tour helped us find other stuff to see. So until further review.",

The boat ride out was fun but the highlight is of course the parasailing. The ascent is very cool and smooth and once you are up there it is absolutely breathtaking! It's calmer and quieter once sailing up above than while riding the boat. The view is amazing and the captain did a very good job of giving us various views by driving the boat around while we were up there. Lots of dolphins and sea lions to see. A few whale sightings from a distance. All in all very very cool! My wife, my 8 year old and I went up together and it was a great ride!",

Once we arrived - we checked in on the computer - waited a short time and headed outside. Kodi was preparing the boat so that we could depart. He explained a few safety rules and gave a brief description of how things were going to go once it was time to begin our parasailing adventure. Me and my boyfriend did the 800 foot and purchase a go Pro camera and it was totally a awesome experience and an adrenaline rush like you wouldn’t believe. You get a beautiful view of all the mountains and downtown San Diego - a site you would never believe. The landing was smooth - as we were coming down - he dipped us in the water just to our knees- pulled us back up and then pulled us to safety. This was one of those experiences that will never be forgotten and I highly recommend to anybody who has not tried this. The staff was super friendly and you will have an amazing time!",

Fun to jump on.\n\nIt was super crowded however, and a great place for dogs to fight because their owners can't keep distance between them while passing.\n\nInfo: free parking and entry all around the neighborhood, we went on the side closer to Balboa park, spent about 20 minutes taking pictures and walking around it, then left.",

Everything as far as drinks and view was amazing BUT the service and the whole set up was just awful.\n\nFirst I would like to say that after our second round of trying to buy drinks and place a small appetizer, we were extremely confused... we went up to the bar since we were sitting on the couches, we tried to place an order and the bartender said she couldn’t place our food order since we were sitting on the couches. She gave us menus and mentioned that a server will take care of us, the host came in and said she would give us a different menu since it was happy hour.... fifteen minutes later nobody showed up, so we asked a guy walking around if he could take our order. The guy mentioned he would bring a server, when he came  back he mentioned we couldn’t sit at the couches since it was “dinner” and we needed a group of six people or more. We told him we had people waiting, he said he would ask and get back to us. Let me just mentioned that the location was pretty slow from the moment we got there which was 2pm. Anyways, then our host stopped by and said “Oh I forgot about the menus” and honestly for how slow it was, how could you forget to bring the menus?? For how slow it was??? I would understand if they were busy. By that point we were over it and realized that maybe our money is no good here?\n\nAnyways hopefully next time is better.",

The ride itself was a blast. We did get a glimpse of whales, dolphins and a sea lion although they did not cooperate fully and were being a little shy. The captain made it entertaining and the views were top notch. If we ever get back here we will definitely be back. Thanks for making our trip memorable.",

I booked a whale watching adventure with Adventure Rib Rides and we had some unusually bad weather for San Diego...Adventure Rib Rides was great at contacting me and helping move my adventure to a time when the weather was clearing up. Every wildlife adventure is different and you can't control wild animals, but on our adventure we were able to get up close with some sea lions and some Pacific white-sided dolphins and were treated to seeing 9 gray whales including a calf. Captain Spencer was awesome, explained things in great detail, was very experienced and a lot of fun. I've done some whale watching tours in Alaska and Hawaii on the \"big boats\" and the experience in the RIB boat does not compare. It is fantastic and well worth a premium price. Highly recommend these guys and if back in the area, I would definitely do a tour with them again.",

He made a real effort to make sure we were comfortable and having a great time during the entire trip. I highly recommend Adventure Rib Rides to anyone who wants to go whale watching. The small (6 passenger) boats provide great viewing  opportunities and personalized service.",

The boat is quick and tiny, not a large cruise liner. Makes the whole experience much more intimate. Kirk was an amazing captain and extremely funny! If it weren’t for the two baby humpback whales and huge pod of dolphins we saw, he would’ve been the best part! Highly recommended tour and I’d even go again. Keep up the good work!",

Everything about this place is phenomenal, the service was top-notch, our server was so friendly and responsive and our food came out so quickly. My girlfriends and I went for Sunday brunch and we had the best time, we got the croissant sandwiches with their own croissants from their bakery. We also got the fromage plate and it was to die for! They also just built a new outdoor space and it's just the best place to spend a Sunday. They have great specials too with late-night happy hours and weekend brunch. Can't recommend this place enough, the owners are some of the nicest people I've met, you have to come check it out!",

This place has the absolute best french baguette money can buy. Today, I got the twice baked almond and chocolate croissant. It was delicious and not what I expected. More dense than a normal croissant. It has a moist almond chocolate center.  I will definitely get this again.",

Every design feature in the home is done with quality and ingenuity for creating the most usable space. The furniture and decor is high quality and in great condition. The location of the house can't be beat! Right off the bay with multiple views of the water. With two decks to enjoy the outdoors, one being down and the other up on the top floor, make bringing the outdoors inside and very usable. The wall of movable glass doors that open fully are a wonderful feature as well. The whole place has a super cool vibe and is designed to perfection. It was perfect for our needs and we really enjoyed staying there. We were attending our son's wedding and multiple activities so we really didn't get a chance to enjoy the area, but I would have loved to do that too. There are cool spots close by!",

Everything you need, well stocked kitchen, comfy beds, laundry on premises, responsive management team. This was our second year booking this property and it was like a home away from home. Attached to the main house by a two car garage, owners have not been there when we’ve rented. Very well maintained property. Big surf destination. We have lots of family and friends in San Diego having lived there and this is a great place to bring people together and eat, drink and be merry! Front yard has a propane fire pit with six chairs and table with six chairs in the back. Would definitely book again.",

It was a small sail-boat, nothing fancy, but wonderful and enjoyable nonetheless; just us and the other couple and the captain, total 5 people. It was a 2-hour ride and the weather was perfect. They, of course, use the engine to get out and then the sail goes up and the engine goes off and the quiet begins; very nice indeed. Lots of interesting things to see in the harbor, seals, sea-lions, other boats, things in the distance.  Out captain was very knowledgeable about sailing and sites in the harbor. The other couple that went were very delightful, and we all laughed and had a great time together. Again, Captain Allen was fantastic; we enjoyed our little adventure very much and would recommend it without hesitation, it really exceeded what I was expecting.",

The boat offers multiple seats to choose from allowing for different views of the scenery.  The tour included history of serval old ships and random fun facts about the area. I saw dolphins and watched a seaplane land right beside us during sunset. Captain Terri was a great guide and very hospitable.  Overall great experience and highly recommend!!!\n\n-Lina",

Parking is good unless there is a holiday in which then it will be very crowded and also in the parking spot that we used you don’t have to pay",

Many restrooms in two locations, a beautiful pier to walk to on the wide boardwalk, and a beautiful, large playground between the beach and the grassy picnic area (that also has grills).  The beach is perfect for swimming, snorkeling and kayaking as it has really easy access without larger breaking waves that you'll find at other local beaches. A gorgeous beach.  Gets very busy though as it's so perfect and close to the college.",

Happy Captain Greg acts as a tour guide in addition to his captaining duties, which makes for a great trip. We did see whales, multiple times, and the ship holds just 6 per tour so we were comfortable and up close. This is now my go-to tour and I’d highly recommend it to friends and family! (My pix of the whales are in video so just posting the lovely sunset we saw as we returned to port.)",

It starts with their impeccable accommodation with scheduling.  My wife and I were unable to make our initial flight due to weather in the Midwest and, thus, we were unable to make our initial reservation with Sail San Diego.  The GM, Cal, was extremely understanding and accommodating and kindly shifted our reservation back a day without penalty so we could still get the experience while on our getaway.  \n\nThe experience itself was SUPERB!  We were extremely fortunate enough to get Frank as our guide.  Frank, who has several decades of sailing experience, was absolutely wonderful.  He was extremely knowledgeable, a terrific captain, and was one of the most personable tour guides I had ever encountered.  The boats themselves are stunning.  Everything from the deck to the helm and everything in between was plush and very relaxing.  The hospitality they provided was beyond imagination and far superseded our anticipations.  Put it this way, we left with full bellies and a good Chardonnay afternoon buzz (not to worry, we Uber'ed it home).  \n\nWe are already planning on coming back and bringing our families so they can also experience Sail San Diego, which proved to be our favorite San Diego experience!  Thank you again Cal, Frank and the Sail San Diego Team!  \n\nDr. G (Solomon)",

We got the private rental for 6 , the fridge was stocked with beer , wine and snacks. We played our own music, got under blankets, sipped some wine, saw a spectacular sunset. We even saw a cruise ship real close which was cool. It is a slower paced activity, almost meditative :)",

Loved having the small party of 6 passengers, freedom to navigate the boat, and take in the California beauty.  Well-stocked boat and Captain is a very skilled sailor. When we observe the large whale-watching ships from afar, they looked packed and uncomfortable. This experience is very much worth the value!",

We were able to park close to the entrance, the longest time we waited in line was maybe 5 minutes if that. We saw most of the shows and were able to sit just about anywhere we wanted because the park was not crowded at all! The staff were friendly and put everything into their show even with the small crowd. I think off season during the week is the best time to visit if you're able.",

Nice place to take kids.\nIt hosts some animal based shows like Sea Lion, Killer Whale and Dolphin show. The dolphin show is awesome and breathtaking. It also has animals kept for just watching. The animals are well trained and well behaved. So it is easy to interact with them. \nIt also some of the best roller coaster rides like Electric Eel, Manta etc. You can enjoy with your family, as everyone has attraction according to their taste.\nI have thoroughly enjoyed the park.Nice place to hang out with kids",

The lines were very long and sometimes you have to wait up to an hour in line to eat. Were the wristbands worth it? Maybe it was a break even? Probably a better deal when the park is open longer in the summer.",

We hit up three shows (dolphins, sea lions/otters, and orcas) and they were all fun for kids and adults.  Lots of creatures to see and touch throughout the park as well as rides and play areas for all ages.\n\nWe brought in a few snacks to help our kids push through a bit longer.  We stopped at Mama Stella's for a late lunch and spent around $50 to feed four people.  About what you'd expect for amusement park fare.  There are bathrooms with changing tables and drinking fountains throughout the park.   We also had a stroller and for most of the  indoor exhibits/shows you will need to leave the stroller outside.\n\nThe roller coasters were surprisingly good!  We went on the Manta and Electric Eel.  Both really fun for those who meet the height requirement.  \n\nI was not impressed by the parks cleanliness which is why I rated it four stars.\n\nAll in all, they do a great job entertaining and educating you about the animals in their care and I'd recommend a visit if you're looking for something to do in San Diego.",

Helped raise the sails.  Felt like part of the crew looking for the whales. Amazing and friendly crew. Al was funny and personable.  Perfect for my 9 year old!  Good price and free snacks. Wonderful experience. If your trying to decide what boat to do I highly recommend this one!",

My kids said it was the most amazing thing they have ever experienced. They went into thinking they would not see anything and get sea sick and neither happened. No sea sickness and they saw whales, sea lions, and a pod of dolphins. She said it was her best birthday ever!",

Absolutely worth it, even if you don't see a whale. \n\nI was a little skeptical about this tour as things like this are typically very cheesy...not into that. However, it was NOT the case here at all here. \n\nThis was classy and chill. \n\nMy wife and I were in SD for the weekend and figured what the hell, let's give this a go. It did not disappoint! \n\nThe crew was extremely friendly, knowledgeable, and helpful. They provided drinks and snacks at no cost too! \n\nIt was a SMOOTH ride. Very low risk for seasickness. \n\nWe did get to see a humpback whale so that was so cool! Honestly though, it was such an enjoyable and relaxing cruise, I wouldn't have cared much if we didn't see one. \n\nThere are no actual seats on this ship because it is a true replica of The Yacht America from 1851. There are plenty of places to sit though!",

The water was like bath water warm and the security made the environment feel rather safe.\n\nIt isn't far from Little Italy of looking for a nice bit to eat (vegan friendly options available as well) and the ships gave a wonderful view. Very calm, very relaxed and I would like to visit again soon.",

The addition of water play area is a hit amongst people of all groups. Kids to adults they just enjoy playing in the water or sitting with their toes dipped watching the ships sail by.\nAlso the play park and walking trails are well developed and positioned if someone wants to take a stroll. The underground parking lot is ideally located so that you do not have to cross any roads to reach this beautiful spot and is just a few steps away.\nMust visit if you are visiting SD downtown.",

The best day was the 3rd day of diving because 2 other boats in the area had left so there was more shark activity. I booked the family room which was for two people. It had its own bathroom and was pretty spacious. Guadalupe Island is beautiful. We had beautiful weather the entire trip. The crew was super nice and made the trip so much more incredible. The only thing I wish I had done was to bring my own wetsuit tailored more towards my curves but the crew still made sure I was comfortable. I highly recommend this company and location for shark enthusiasts!",

Martin and Cindy with Shark Diver were willing to answer our questions both before and during our trip. There were plenty of options for cage time throughout the 3 days! They even provided go pro rentals so you could video your trip and at the end the crew with the help of photos from Martin made us an 8 minute slide show that we all were able to bring home.

One of the craziest things is how much food they go through every single day 13000 different Mills are served every single day . And it's crazy to think that our technology is improving even more allowing for bigger carriers and maybe even one day an aircraft Carrier that can go airborne and not just be in the ocean.",

The ship is filled with interesting and educational displays highlighting the 47 years this ship was in service including two major renovations. Many of the aircraft that took off from the ship were on display.  It appears that many of the docents who serve on this ship were actually members of the crew at one time.  Almost all had a fascinating story to tell about some element or operation on the ship.  While not all of the ship was open to tour because of covid, we spent 4 hours and still didn't see everything available.  This museum makes for an incredible family experience.  I highly recommend it.  Every visitor will come away with some new knowledge and an appreciation for life in the military.",
