The BBQ and spicy ranch sauces tasted amazing, no matter what you put them on. The service was by far the best part. As someone who works in the food service industry I know how hard it can get right before we shutdown for the night. So it made it even more amazing when Adam was kind and helpful, even though we showed up right before they closed down for the night. He was well versed in the food and was an all around awesome guy. He made the wait for our food enjoyable with fantastic conversation and made the night better than expected.",

It is now 11:50 and they still have not managed to give us the vaccine.\nPerhaps pharmacies should stop giving vaccines until they can hire/retain or retrain staff.
