I accidentally left my purse behind . We were the  last customers to leave and the door was locked behind us. Not long after, someone literally ran down the street to catch us and bring me my purse that I had yet to discover missing. It had EVERYTHING in it! The shops would have been closed , I believe, until Monday and we were headed out of town. What a lifesaver this young lady was to me!! And such a blessing to meet someone so honest and forthright! I didn’t get her name but she works there and I can’t give high enough praise for Mayberry’s and in particular this kind young woman! Thank you from the bottom of my heart! !",

For the price, I expected bold, adult flavors but received boring and pedestrian. The hostess was very nice and personable but the waitress was lacking. After offering us a wine list and informing us that they don't know how to make a lot of cocktails, even though there have a full bar, she then took our drink order and afterwards  decided to card us even though I'm almost 40. Unfortunately I had lost my wallet so I didn't get to drink, but my husband had an old fashioned that was way over poured. All in all, I wouldn't come back for the price we paid. It seems the wait staff are in need of training and a little common sense and the chef needs to find the salt and pepper.",

Tender juicy meat with a great  smoky flavor.  NO SAUCE NEEDED..  The brisket is great and the pulled pork sandwiches.  Fries are good too. Great sauces to choose from but you won't need it to flavor anything but maybe as a dip for the fries.. Only had one person's BBQ that was better but he only has it  on occasion at his restaurant.",

All of the meat was lean and cooked perfectly. Everything was served with care and package nicely for our picnic. We enjoyed our lunch from Blue smoke Express BBQ very much!",

As someone who works in the food service industry I know how hard it can get right before we shutdown for the night.

Was asked to answer same questions that I answered online, this time verbally then handed the forms to answer same questions for 3rd time.  It is now 11:50 and they still have not managed to give us the vaccine.\nPerhaps pharmacies should stop giving vaccines until they can hire/retain or retrain staff.  Just a thought but really I have not been to a pharmacy that handles vaccines well.\nI recommend that folks go to their doctor's office.  Wait time would be much less.",

The window display is tasteful and eye-catching, so I went in the other day to check it out, as I am a fan of screen printing and local art.\n\nIf you want a cute greeting or thank-you card, go here. If you need some art for your (or a friend's) home, go here. If you want a unique t-shirt with a clean print, go here! If you need that one last color of Gelly Roll for your pen collection, there are a TON of them here. If you like raccoons, hiking, flowers, trees, foxes, mushrooms, and nature in general, you'll love this store. There are even sketchbooks and screen printing supplies! I found a great Black Balsam print for a friend; and I will definitely be going back periodically to see what new items are released, as I was a big fan of the styles of artwork as well as their presentation. Shop small!",

We purchased the big green bucket and were amazed by how many gemstones we got (not to mention a HUGE geode)! Unfortunately there was a bit of a mixup when we were checking out and our bags with our emeralds, rubies, and other gemstones was misplaced. I didn't realize this until we got home and called to see if it was still at the store. It wasn't, but they made up for it by sending us a box of dirt to mine for gemstones at home! They really went above and beyond and I highly recommend you check this place out. Prices are great, staff is fantastic - you won't be disappointed!",

We were able to select a box of 4 truffles for each guest and pick the flavors! Every single piece was delicious and they were wrapped in a cute box and bow. Our guests loved them! They had the chocolates ready for us to pick up on time and in perfect condition! Would highly recommend using them for your event, as well as just stopping in to get some delicious treats!",

The BBQ and spicy ranch sauces tasted amazing, no matter what you put them on. The service was by far the best part. As someone who works in the food service industry I know how hard it can get right before we shutdown for the night. So it made it even more amazing when Adam was kind and helpful, even though we showed up right before they closed down for the night. He was well versed in the food and was an all around awesome guy. He made the wait for our food enjoyable with fantastic conversation and made the night better than expected.",

It's at the foot of one of the most unique trail systems in the country where rides are measured in hours, not by miles. If you have a part or a piece on your bike that needs fixing? Done. You need to upgrade one? Done. You need advice about life, love and politics? Sit down and have a beer. They've got plenty on tap. And dang good food trucks. If you're in the area, drop by, you won't regret it.",

Last year when we came I couldn’t wait to come back. No longer the case. Also few gluten free options.",

The bar staff seems challenged to preform under very busy conditions. This is a pretty large venue with several inside rooms in addition to outside. Bar service slow, food arrived pretty timely though and was prepared very well.",

That's where the good things ended.  We arrived with our party of 8 and were told by the first hostess, \"we only seat tables of 6, sorry.\"  I replied, we can split our group up into 4 and 4, to which she said no sorry we can't do that.  What in the world?!?!  The couple who were sat outside enjoying their meal were as completely dumbfounded as we were.  We proceeded to walk away, when were met by their second hostess, after more confusion about seating, she explained she could seat us outside that they had room outside.  Then, as if she was steering us away from eating there she saw we had four children ages 9 to 13 and stated they did not have a kids menu.  She gave the menu to one of our kids, looking at him as if he wasn't going to like anything they served.  We had had enough at that point, and told them no thank you.  Never have I ever been to a place supposedly called the \"Neighborhood Eatery\" who was more inclined to dismiss a group of paying customers.  Whether the food was good or not, we'll never know, but the service was atrocious!",

The hike was so incredibly short, I’d refer to it as a casual walk. It is an easy walk for anyone who wants to see a good waterfall, without a long or difficult hike. Really nice-looking waterfall, and I imagine during hotter weather, a dip in the pool at the bottom would be amazing.",

The first stop we went to was the waterfall which was just magnificent. The water directly under the fall is bone chilling my goodness! After leaving the waterfall, the sliding rock was next, which is a huge smooth rock with flowing water over it, that has been used as a water slide. The water is slightly warmer than the waterfall. My first experience at a waterfall was a success!",

There is parking along the road and also a small parking area if you drive just past the falls.\n\n2.  The area is very clean.\n\n3.  You can see the falls from the street. There are steps and railing that lead you down to the water.  Once you reach the water you can walk out on huge rocks (careful, they are slippery) and even swim into and beneath the falls.\n\n4.  It can be very crowded but it's a nice place for families and even kids (as long as you have pretty good mobility).\n\n5.  The view is amazing.  There aren't really good areas to picnic or even just lounge around near the base of the falls.  You really just have to make room for yourself and your family and enjoy being in nature.\n\n6.  Obviously, there are no bathrooms.  Use it before you come!",

The steps are manageable to get down to the base of the waterfall. If you go swimming, prepare yourself to acclimate to the rush of air that comes off the falls. You will need to practice your breathing before you jump in. Enjoy!\n\n🥾ATTN: Hiking Boots or Water shoes are highly recommended. I grabbed a pair of Astral all purpose outdoor shoes from Davidson Outfitters at the intersection there in town. They worked perfectly, inside and outside of the water.",

For the same price of renting a car and fuel, we were able to get a last minute flight from Avl to Iad. That puts us one exit away from our home. Its a cute, nice airport. The staff are very helpful. The jet was small, but very comfy. We flew United and made it home in an hr and a half for less than 600 for the both of us. That was purchased 3hrs before the flight. We will now fly here to visit family. I never knew there were regular flights from close to home to close to family for very low price, especially if booked in advance. We will now fly in and out of here every few months. Such a great experience",

Tender and well seasoned pork, softest buns, freshest and yummy fries and hush puppies! We will go back asap on another day trip. The service was amazing too! Well worth every penny and every minute leading up to it. Their sauces were wonderful too! Especially the vinegar western one. I even asked if they had a sister company here, which they don't. ☹️. True Carolina BBQ and truly a wonderful restaurant and atmosphere! I am 100% thankful that I found them on Google. 😋😋😋🤗💖 By the way, they had the cleanest and nicest restroom that I have ever seen.",

Unfortunately these folks don't always pay attention,  when you call in they're not really listening. Almost each and every time that we go in there about every other week to pick up our order, there's something missing.\n\nEven though we ask them to double check the order it's always something, extra sauce missing, ear of corn missing, coleslaw missing. I just don't understand why they can't pay a little bit more attention, slow down and understand what's being said on the telephone and then have some quality control process to make sure that they are putting what was ordered in the bag. We are dropping them down to three stars. The food is still good but the service suffers due to inattention.\n\n-----_---\nActually these guys have a couple of different kinds of barbeque. Dry rub  and a southern 1 more of a honey, sweet, and that kind of thing. both of them very good they also have a number of  good side dishes. Hush Puppies are Excellenent , and of course sweet tea!",

The customer service provided by the manager was terrible. She was nothing but rude and accusatory before we even entered our complaint. The baker oversold her capabilities and our \"sage green and gold drip cake\" was called by a guest \"Nickelodeon green Slime and orange.\" It was so far from what we requested, we refused to display it for the remainder of our guests out of embarrassment. The only saving grace in the matter was the owner of the bakery, Katina, who was sweet and apologetic. She refunded a portion of our money, which was appreciated but unfortunately that does not provide us a presentable cake for our wedding day. The appetizers were good, but please do go elsewhere for your wedding cake.",

We've done the tour a few times, sadly it's not being offered at the moment but hopefully they'll bring that back soon.

We definitely wouldn't of known to go to such an incredible place without learning about New Belgium's history. The beer is delicious and very fairly priced. The staff is the absolute best! This brewery is unlike any other and it's in a great location that overlooks the French broad river. They also have food trucks that park out front in addition to a big lawn to chill on. Go check them out!!",

Let's talk about the BLT. It was the best I've ever had in my life. The bread is something called milk bread, the bacon is a thick cut sugar cure that should be patented, thick slices of tomatoes and Dukes mayo. To die for. My husband got the spicy fried chicken sandwich, which he loved, but it was a little too hot for him. I probably would have been fine with it. Also, its not on the menu,  but they will make a doggie chicken burger for $5.00. Also great beer, and a lovely outdoor seating area.",

They have expanded a ton and have a lot of outdoor space, much of it with heaters.  Definitely a go-to when I'm in town!\n\nOriginal review (a while ago) Pretend like you don’t care and they might serve you. The beer is delicious and well done. However they don’t care about you as a patron. You’ll wait forever and then they will show that they’re not in a hurry. I sat on the patio and apparently never made eye contact with the “servers” out there.",

Indoor/out, shady, etc. service was solid. The group loved the pretzels (beware the very spicy grainy mustard!), BLT, and burgers/chips. Sangria and flights are on point.

The BBQ and spicy ranch sauces tasted amazing, no matter what you put them on. The service was by far the best part. As someone who works in the food service industry I know how hard it can get right before we shutdown for the night. So it made it even more amazing when Adam was kind and helpful, even though we showed up right before they closed down for the night. He was well versed in the food and was an all around awesome guy. He made the wait for our food enjoyable with fantastic conversation and made the night better than expected.",

They support local musicians and the talent that day was fun to listen to.",

I said I had called in to add a large milk and I'd like to go ahead and pay for it. Waited outside and TWENTY minutes later they brought my food, milk and the bill. They wanted me to pay $2.10 for the milk. I told them I tried to pay 20 minutes ago and no one came back out and I didn't want to wait any longer for my change. He sarcastically told me to have a good day. I should have told him to take it out of the tip I left. I waited 1 hour and 20 minutes for my food. You can knock off 2 bucks.",

We were immediately sat at the quiet end of the patio which we were very happy about. We were greeted warmly by what I assume was the manager, a runner and a server. They were having some special appetizers that were up our alley. We had the southern fondue, the pork cracklings and cheese plate with flambe peaches. It was all to die for. Midway through our meal a storm started to roll in. The manager came out and made us aware of the situation and moved us immediately under the covered area of the patio before the storm hit with plenty of time to spare. The service was second to none and we will absolutely be back our next visit to town.",

What you might expect at a diner for $10, not the $30 they charged for this. Shame on them for choosing to serve them. I had the Chicken Tuscan Bake and it was very good. You wait in line and then when you get to the counter and can see the menu you have to quickly figure out what to order since there are people waiting behind you. I thought this was strange to use a fast food model for a restaurant that sells $20-$30 entrees.",

You will hurt yourself hiking down in the dark with no light. It's about 3 miles up hill. Grab water also and maybe a granola bar. The view will not disappoint.",

I understand the uniqueness of the steaming process that they have here, but it seems that it negates the whole point of what makes a bagel a bagel, both flavor and texture-wise. It might be a little bit of a petty perspective on my end, but I feel like not toasting a bagel, especially for $6-8+ sandwiches from a place where the whole bit IS the bagel, is a little odd, especially for a breakfast sandwich, and definitely prevents it from being the solid comfort food it could be. I would still recommend trying it at least once, though, since it IS a unique preparation and might be someone else’s “cup of tea” more so than my own.",

Their establishment is quick and efficient at taking your order and getting your food to you. Their service is great and their food is delicious. More importantly to me however is that their prices are great. You could feed a small African village with the $13 bento box they have here. I couldn't justify going this place anything less than 5*.",

I would definitely eat there again if the portions of food was more. We had the duck meatballs which was 3 small meatballs with broth and it was $16 for a bowl. Again the food was excellent just small in portions.",

They fixed my bike and tuned up my sons for a very reasonable price.  This is my bike store going forward!",

Chaos would be a better description.\n\nWhen we came in, there were seven tables seated. Ten or so tables weren't bussed and a few were. I counted five servers including the bar.  So, four up front serving seven tables... Didn't make sense.\n\nWith the number of tables seated, you would think they wouldn't be short staffed and I think if they were better organized, they would have managed just fine.\n\nThe servers were running around acting like tables were unassigned. The food came out from the kitchen separately for every table, not just ours. It was five minutes apart at one table (I actually timed it - 4 minutes 50 seconds). There was no one at the front to seat us, I had to go ask at the bar if we were going to seat ourselves. No one was clearing and cleaning tables. In fact just before we left, a customer started clearing tables.\n\nThat being said, the food was fairly good. Pollo con Crema and Taco salad. The bean dip and tortillas were decent as well.\n\nNot a particularly pleasant experience. If we're in the area again I might give Maya's a second chance.",

Bad cell service in the area for T-Mobile and Verizon for some reason.\nIn the area, highly recommend stopping by.",

We also had a fantastic waiter who was so attentive and absolutely wonderful overall. He asked us about the types of beer we like and then brought us different samples he recommended. We definitely ended up buying more beer from the beer store than we originally planned because of him, but we have no regrets! I wish I could remember his name, but he was there the afternoon of August 31st and he knew the scientific name of my leg tattoo. He deserves a bonus!",

They have a great variety of beers that accommodate all types of beer drinkers. To make it better, they have a great atmosphere to accompany their beers and sell many of their beers they have on tap to take home! Personal preference for me is for pub style breweries to have a little more imagination on the burger front, and the fries are crispy, but again lacking in imagination. My only reason for rating it 4 stars. Will definitely come back when in town again!",
