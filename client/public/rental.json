In the beach alleys, recycling bins attract scavengers who rummage through the bins late at night to illegally collect recyclables, leaving strewn trash behind. In such high-density communities, sometimes there isn’t enough room for trash and recycle bins, so others will place refuse in the recycle bins and the city will not empty those containers, leading to unsanitary conditions. We have tried locking the bins, but if guests do not unlock in time for collection, the bins will stay full and there is not enough room for overflow. We are petitioning the city for other solutions and apologize for any inconvenience this may cause you. If you have any concerns or suggestions, we welcome your call.",
