We will be frequent patrons... so excited!",

For the same price of renting a car and fuel, we were able to get a last minute flight from Avl to Iad. That puts us one exit away from our home. Its a cute, nice airport. The staff are very helpful. The jet was small, but very comfy. We flew United and made it home in an hr and a half for less than 600 for the both of us. That was purchased 3hrs before the flight. We will now fly here to visit family. I never knew there were regular flights from close to home to close to family for very low price, especially if booked in advance. We will now fly in and out of here every few months. Such a great experience",

This was all in vain since the scheduling is so poor with this airport. The departing and returning flights were both over 45 minutes late. Then, when we returned home we were stuck on the taxiway due to a plane being in the way since they were also late. We were stuck for over 30 minutes. We will never, ever fly out of this airport again if we don’t have to. The scheduling is poor and unreliable, and the facilities are cramped. McGee-Tyson is far superior and reliable.",

Bathrooms and dining room are generally reasonably clean, but there have been many visits where the restaurant was mostly empty and yet there was not a single clean table to be found. That said, we certainly arent above cleaning up here and there and understand that just because it doesnt look busy at the moment, doesn't mean its not- so four stars!

She really worked the knots out in my back and gave a lot of pressure that I needed to be able to get those spots taken care of. Thank you so much Rhonda! I look forward to visiting again real soon. So glad to have them here in Waynesville!",

Our only disappointment is that they were not open on Sunday so we could visit again!   Everything was so good!  The service, the sweet tea, the rolls, tomato bisque soup (I almost ordered a to go serving, it was so good!), taco salad, chicken salad, Caroline burger and OH My Goodness the coconut cake was heavenly!!!  Top of our list of places to stop!!",

I would highly recommend The Lambuth Inn to anyone traveling in this area.",

So to get me to leave a review it would have to be really good or really bad. In this case REALLY BAD   We arrived at 3am. The man checking us in was clueless it took an hour to check in. My wife noticed there was a note on the desk that said a women came down to the desk and brought BED BUGS from her room. I was scared at this point to check in but we had just drove 6 hours in the car and it was Valentine’s Day and our anniversary so we proceeded to the room. We asked for a nice room we were told we had a lake view.  Which I guess we did if you stuck you head out the window and could look around the building but mostly they stuck us in a back corner. We left the room in good order we had drank a 6 pack of beer and we left the empty bottles in the trash can. We knew it was a Christian hotel but there was nothing that said you couldn’t drink a beer. We left a $10 tip for the maid and left.  We were told the room was $149 per night. When I received my credit card statement I had three separate charges on my card one for $149 one for $464.19 and another for $292.37. There explication was there were beer bottles in the room. Thank God for American Express I won’t be paying this bill. And the manager I spoke to about this was nasty. DO NOT STAY AT THIS HOTEL!!",

Definitely stop by at the top of the hour to hear their beautiful chimes.  Decent path around the lake, although narrow in places.  People seem to think they are the only ones there, as they seem surprised when we call 'on your left' as we pass.  Loved the bridges and one lane bridge.  Just such a nice place to get some miles in.  Park near the acquatic center.",

Ordered subs online and they didn’t make the order, or call me, to ask what bread I’d like since they were out of what I ordered.  Also ordered 1/2 lb of sliced cheese that WAS ready for pickup. As I checked out I noticed they charged me for 1 lb. I weighed it at home and it was 1/2lb. I didn’t stop to complain because my warm sub was for someone waiting in my car for 30 minutes already, due to the bread issue.",

The staff was generous and very attentive with making sure we got our order out on time. If you were all in Greensboro, I'd be going here more often than I should.

I SAID SORRY and I would get it but once again asked my question one yet she ignored me and hatefully said again and again You NEED TO HAVE A MASK ON IN THE LOBBY until finally I just had to walk away.

What a way to spend my first night in the mountains of western NC.\n\nI decided to veer off the road , on my way to Maggie Valley, to see Lake Junaluska,  for a bite to eat and was most pleasantly surprised by this beautiful Lakeside town.\n\nThis is my first time here , and I googled for outside dining in Lake Junaluska, and found the bistro Lakeside at the Terrace.\n\nThe outside dining is on the third floor, and has the most spectacular view of the lake and the sunset.\n\nEveryone at the bistro went out of their way to make sure I had a fabulous experience.it was a chilly night but they had heaters and it was perfect.\n\nI started with a small Caesar salad,  which had\nto be one of the best Caesar salad’s I’ve ever had !\n\nEverything is made from scratch, and I ordered  the buttermilk chicken with the Brussels sprouts, and the macaroni and cheese .👍👍👍\nSo fantastic.\n\nJust a note, there is no alcohol served here yet,  but if you have your own wine or beer, you can bring it in. I happened  to have a bottle of wine with me so that worked out quite well.\n\nI also splurged, and had dessert which was the fresh berry crisp. Yummy.\n\nEverything was delicious , and so much food!!\n\nI want to say thank you to Chef Sam, my server Megan, and also the host, Daniel . As I’m  on a  vacation, Chef Sam who is a native , came out to talk with me about the area and where to go. He was so helpful!\nThank you , Chef Sam!\n\nThe downstairs lobby level has a very large fireplace and beautiful floor to ceiling  windows overlooking the lake, and rugged rustic wood, and  glass and stone walls.\n\nEverything was very beautiful and I am glad I ventured off my path to find this place.👏👏\n\nThank you!\n\nJennifer from Deerfield Beach, Florida",

Our server Javan was attentive and professional so we felt very well taken care of! I must admit, I grew up in the area and had very little experience with dining at Lake Junaluska but it seems the new owners/management have breathed new life into the place! I had a lovely perfectly dressed salad and a cup of the soup, my mother had the artichoke spinach dip as her meal... oh my!! Absolutely heavenly! We were so full, we had to order our desserts to go!! I will definitely be back and I highly recommend that if you're in the area to stop in. This is a gem of a dining experience with relaxing views of the lake.",
